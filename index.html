                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ciana Ruggiero and I am a senior at KSU majoring in Interactive Design. I also enjoy illustration and character design as well as 3D modeling. I have the most experience with 2D digital art, but have worked a good bit in traditional art as well. I have experience with 3D modeling in Blender and prototyping experience in Figma. I have included a variety of all of these mediums in my portfolio to show all I can do!</p>

                <h2>My Time at KSU</h2>
                <p>I am currently a senior at KSU, with graduation planned for Fall 2025. I originally began at KSU as a dual enrolled high school student. When I graduated from my high school, I transitioned to be a full time student. I went through a few different majors before finally landing in Interactive Design, a major through which I discovered my love of Web Development. I have become versed in Figma and many Adobe Suite applications, and am currently learning about the coding side of it to further my knowledge.</p>

                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>My name is Ciana Ruggiero and I am a 20 year old artist and designer. As a child, I went through many phases of being unable to put a pencil down to not drawing for months. I had been out of it for a while when COVID hit, and with all that added free time, I rekindled my love of drawing, and it has been going strong ever since. I have also always wanted to do something creative for a career, but wanted to keep art more as a hobby. That's when I found the Game Design major at KSU. I stuck with it for a while, but eventually found my love of design was better suited for Interactive Design, which I have been studying ever since.</p>
                    <h2>My Experiences</h2>
                    <p>Currently, I am an intern for a company called 80 Level. 80 Level is a company that works in many different spaces, working some with game design, some with major game companies such as Epic Games and Roblox, as well as some UI/UX. Aside from this, I am working hard to improve my skills in my spare time in hopes to begin freelancing before graduation. I do not have much professional expereince yet, but I am extremely excited for whatever future projects I will be able to add to this porfolio!</p>
                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                    <p>I have a wide variety of goals, especially with the multiple creative fields I would love to work in. For my personal art, I will soon begin working towards commissions and possibly a shop one day. If I practice my skills correctly, I hope this could also extend into graphic design. Through my internship, I have been learning 3D modeling, and would love to a career as a 3D modeler, as that was my original goal when I first decided to major in Game Design. Most realistically, I hope to improve my work with UI/UX and be able to freelance in the future, as well as begin my professional career with a job as a UI/UX or Web Designer.</p>
